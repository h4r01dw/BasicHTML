<h1>Quinnipiac University</h1>
<hr>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Quinnipiac began as a small college in New Haven in 1929.  In the early 1960s, Quinnipiac purchased land across from Sleeping Giant State Park, which is now the Mount Carmel Campus.  Quinnipiac transitioned from a college to a university in 2000, and has since grown into a national university with eight schools and colleges and two additional campuses.</p>

<p>"Quinnipiac," pronounced (KWIN-uh-pe-ack), is an altered version of a Native American word.  Theories differ on the word's exact meaning.  Some sources, such as "The Quinnipiac Indians and Their Reservation," written in 1900, assert that the name <i>Quinni-pe-auke</i> means "long-water land or country" and that <i>Quinnipiack</i> means "people from the long-water land."  Later sources claim the word Quinnipiac apparently derives from <i>quinnuppin-uk</i>, defined as "a turning point" or "to make a change in the direction of travel."  Both definitions seem appropriate for Quinnipiac, which is near a long tidal river and which marks a turning point in students' lives.</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>An education at Quinnipiac embodies the University's commitment to three core values: high-quality academic programs, a student-oriented environment and a strong sense of community.  The University prepares undergraduate and graduate students for achievement and leadership in business, communications, engineering, health, education, law, medicine, nursing and the liberal arts and sciences</p>

<p>Quinnipiac University educates students to be valued and contributing members of their communities through a vital, challenging and purposeful educational program.
